# Hindi Sarcasm detection

Sarcasm detection is a nuanced task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves identifying when a statement is meant to convey the opposite of its literal meaning. This project focuses on detecting sarcasm in Hindi, a major language spoken by millions worldwide. Given the complexity of sarcasm, which often relies on cultural context, tone, and subtlety, detecting it in Hindi presents unique challenges and opportunities.
